# **Short Description**

PepeDex is a small project designed to gather data about **_main Pokemon games_** and present it in a neat and convenient way. All the information is retrieved from [Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co/)

PepeDex is entirely written in Python and the GUI is created using **_tkiner_**.

It allows you to browse information about every Pokemon up to Generation 8 (introduced in 2020). PepeDex stores information about Pokemon's:
* Types
* Moves
* Abilities
* Misc. curiosities like Pokedex entries or weight

PepeDex can also be used to calculate weak and strong sides of your Pokemon team based on given types of Pokemons in your team.



I hope you'll enjoy your stay and make sure to give feedback what you think I should improve.
Have fun!
